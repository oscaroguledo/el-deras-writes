feat: Implement predefined title options for CustomUser

- Modified `CustomUser` model in `backend/blog/models.py` to use `TITLE_CHOICES` for the `title` field.
- Generated and applied new migration for the `title` field change.
- Updated `backend/seed.py` to assign random titles from `TITLE_CHOICES` during user seeding.
- Replaced the `title` input field with a `select` dropdown in `frontend/src/components/UserFormModal.tsx` to use the predefined title options.
