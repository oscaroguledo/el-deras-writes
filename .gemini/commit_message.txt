fix: Initialize title field in UserFormModal for existing users

Modified `frontend/src/components/UserFormModal.tsx` to correctly initialize the `title` field in the form data when editing an existing user. Previously, the `title` field was not being populated from the `user` object, leading to it being reset to an empty string if not explicitly changed by the user.
