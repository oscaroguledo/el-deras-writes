fix: Render author username instead of object in ArticleDetail

Modified `frontend/src/pages/ArticleDetail.tsx` to correctly render `article.author.username` instead of the entire `article.author` object. This resolves the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error that occurred when attempting to display the author information directly.
