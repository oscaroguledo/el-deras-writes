fix: Correct calculation of average comments per article

Modified `AdminDashboardView` in `backend/blog/views.py` to correctly calculate `avg_comments_per_article`. Previously, it was attempting to aggregate on `Comment.objects.aggregate(avg=models.Avg('article__comments'))`, which led to an `AttributeError` due to incorrect aggregation on a reverse relationship. The fix involves annotating `Article` objects with their comment count and then averaging those counts.
