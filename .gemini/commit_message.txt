fix: Allow blank password field during user updates

Modified `CustomUserSerializer` in `backend/blog/serializers.py` to explicitly set `allow_blank=True` for the `password` field. This resolves the issue where a blank password field during user updates would trigger a "This field may not be blank" validation error, even when `required=False` was set. The `update` method already handles not updating the password if it's blank.
